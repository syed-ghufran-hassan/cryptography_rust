# Salsa20-Stream-Cipher-Implementation-in-Rust
This project implements the Salsa20 stream cipher in Rust, a modern cryptographic algorithm designed for fast and secure encryption of data. The implementation includes key and nonce setup, encryption and decryption functions, and a core Salsa20 algorithm with 20 quarter rounds for robust security. Additionally, the project provides unit tests to verify the correctness of the encryption and decryption processes, including tests for large messages and edge cases like empty inputs.

The Salsa20 cipher is widely used in secure communications and cryptographic applications due to its simplicity, efficiency, and resistance to cryptanalysis. This project demonstrates how to securely encrypt and decrypt messages in a performant and safe manner using Rust.
