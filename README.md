# Cryptography and Rust Development Portfolio

As a Rust developer with a focus on cryptographic implementations, my portfolio showcases proficiency in designing and developing secure, efficient cryptographic algorithms. I have implemented robust symmetric encryption algorithms like Salsa20, ChaCha20, and AES, demonstrating a deep understanding of both the theory and practical applications of cryptographic primitives. My work includes creating efficient encryption libraries, ensuring compliance with industry standards, and producing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

In addition to technical skills, my projects reflect strong problem-solving abilities and a meticulous approach to security and performance, making me a valuable asset for teams seeking expertise in secure software development, blockchain technologies, and system programming.
