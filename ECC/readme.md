# Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in Rust

This Rust project implements basic Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), a modern and efficient asymmetric cryptographic technique. ECC is widely used for secure data encryption, digital signatures, and public key exchanges, especially in environments with constrained resources due to its efficiency compared to other public key methods like RSA.

## Features
Point Generation: Calculate points on an elliptic curve.
Point Addition: Perform addition of two points on the curve.
Scalar Multiplication: Multiply points by a scalar value (used in key generation and encryption).
Basic ECC Operations: Demonstrates the fundamental operations of ECC, crucial for encryption and digital signatures


This implementation is designed as a simple introduction to ECC, suitable for learning and demonstrating the mathematics behind elliptic curve cryptography.
